# Shopification
We have built a responsive e-commerce website that could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers' time. Consumers also gain points through online shopping to exchange for exclusive rewards.

# The Purpose & Design Process of this Site.
This website serves to provide E-commerce service which brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online, especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops. The index page which is the main page of this website is the main catch of this project. Products are displayed in the index page so that visitor are attracted to browse for our product. 

The website is user-friendly and designed in such a way that it is easy for user to navigate through and understand the content of the page they're in. The color scheme picked is orange, because orange is the color of the youth, it could not be so attractive like yellow, however it is much cooler. That’s the reason why many brands of youth products focus on orange. We can imagine orange is just like the energy, but not a strong energy like red or glowing energy like yellow. Orange is the energy of youth, friendly and confident. This color makes a buyer feel confident.

This website is mobile friendly and is compatible with any mobile device, this improve the way it looks on devices with both large and small screens, and increase the amount of time that visitors spend on this site as well as improve site rankings in search engines.
