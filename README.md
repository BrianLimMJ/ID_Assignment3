# Shopification
We have built a responsive e-commerce website that will display products using api created using contentful.

- [Github Page](https://brianlimmj.github.io/ID_Assignment3/).

# The purpose of this Site.
This website serves to provide E-commerce service which brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online, especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers' time. Consumers also gain points through online shopping to exchange for exclusive rewards.
